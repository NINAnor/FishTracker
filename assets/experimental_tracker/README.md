# Experimental tracker
Tracker implementation that could be used to replace the existing tracker based on the Sort module. This would enable releasing Fish Tracker under the LGPL license, if needed.

Test file (test.py) serves as an example on how to use the tracker. When running the script, pressing any key on the keyboard will advance the tracking one step at a time.
